                <h2>Lincon's Early life :</h2>
                <p style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Abraham Lincoln</strong> was born on February 12, 1809, the second child of <em>Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks
                    Lincoln</em>, in a log cabin on Sinking Spring Farm near Hodgenville, Kentucky. He was a descendant of
                    Samuel Lincoln, an Englishman who migrated from Hingham, Norfolk, to its namesake, Hingham,
                    Massachusetts, in 1638. The family then migrated west, passing through New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and
                    Virginia.Lincoln was also a descendant of the Harrison family of <strong> Virginia;</strong> his paternal
                    grandfather and namesake,<strong><em> Captain Abraham Lincoln and wife Bathsheba</em></strong> (n√©e Herring) moved the family
                    from Virginia to Jefferson County, Kentucky.The captain was killed in an Indian raid in 1786.
                    His children, including eight-year-old Thomas, Abraham's father, witnessed the attack. Thomas
                    then worked at odd jobs in Kentucky and Tennessee before the family settled in Hardin County,
                    Kentucky, in the early 1800s.
                    The farm site where Lincoln grew up in Spencer County, Indiana

                    Lincoln's mother Nancy Lincoln is widely assumed to be the daughter of Lucy Hanks. Thomas and
                    Nancy married on June 12, 1806, in Washington County, and moved to Elizabethtown, Kentucky.They
                    had three children: Sarah, Abraham, and Thomas, who died as an infant.
